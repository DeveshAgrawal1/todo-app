# todo-app

This is a practice app I built while learning ReactJS. It uses Firebase for storing data.


The functions currently include:
  1. Saving and Deleting the list items.
  2. Editing the item.
  3. CSS animations.
  
For making use of the app, in your terminal execute the following commands:
```
git clone https://github.com/DeveshAgrawal1/todo-app.git
cd todo-app
npm install
gulp
```
